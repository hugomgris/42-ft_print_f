Finished project with no bonus (100 score)

Update: added bonus version to its own subrepository. It's a complete redone ft_printf that handles every flag requested in the subject. I tested the bous functions with this tester: https://github.com/paulo-santana/ft_printf_tester. Everything seems to work fine, at least by Moulinette standards.
